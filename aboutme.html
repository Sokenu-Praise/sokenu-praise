    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Sokenu Praise Oluwajomiloju. I’m a student of Industrial Mathematics and Computer Science with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. I enjoy using logic, creativity, and coding to build simple and useful things especially websites.</p>

<p>I’m currently learning web development, and I love working with HTML and CSS to design clean, user-friendly pages. Outside of academics, I enjoy watching tech videos, listening to music, and discovering new tools that can make life easier.</p>

<p>My goal is to keep improving my skills and work on projects that make a positive impact.</p>
